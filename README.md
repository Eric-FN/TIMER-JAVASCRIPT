# ⏲️ Timer Project

This project is a simple and interactive timer built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The timer allows users to start, pause, and reset the clock with the click of a button. It is a great example of how to work with JavaScript to manipulate the DOM and handle events in real-time.

## Features:
- **Start Timer**: Initiates the timer and begins counting in seconds.
- **Pause Timer**: Pauses the current time without resetting it.
- **Reset Timer**: Resets the timer to `00:00:00`.
- **Responsive Design**: The layout adjusts to different screen sizes for better usability.

## Technologies Used:
- **HTML**: Basic structure of the webpage.
- **CSS**: Styling for the timer and buttons, with a focus on simplicity and readability.
- **JavaScript**: Logic for controlling the timer, including the start, pause, and reset functionalities.

## File Structure:
- `index.html`: The main HTML file containing the structure of the timer interface.
- `style.css`: The CSS file that defines the design of the page, including colors, typography, and button styles.
- `main.js`: The JavaScript file where the timer logic is implemented.

## How to Use:
1. Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
2. Open `index.html` in your browser to view the timer.
3. Click the **Iniciar** (Start) button to begin the timer.
4. Click the **Pausar** (Pause) button to stop the timer.
5. Click the **Zerar** (Reset) button to reset the timer back to `00:00:00`.
